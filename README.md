Repository for the source files and plotting scripts for the VDF paper 1 where we use ESA onboard different spacecrafts to demonstrate the potential of Slepian functions to recover 3D gyrotropic and agyrotropic basis functions. 

In order to have a functional repository, you need to create a few directories inside the main repository directory:
```
mkdir input_data_files output_data_files VDF_paper1_plots
```
